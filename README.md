This project implements a Patient Scheduling System using C++ STL and OOP principles to simulate a healthcare queue prioritization. 
Patients are served based on urgency, ensuring efficient care in a simulated healthcare environment. 
The system leverages data structures, exception handling, and collaborative development with GitHub to enhance teamwork and coding practices.

System Operation Flow

Initialization:
Generate patient data for selected ammount.
Dispatch Patients:
Patients are added to their respective queues based on arrival time.
Serve Patients:
Serve patients from the Urgent Queue first, then from the Normal Queue.
Minute-by-Minute Simulation:
Each simulation step advances with user input (press Enter).
Results Display:
Patient statuses are updated dynamically after each step.
Final statistics are displayed at the end of the simulation.

Deliverables

Code: Clean, modular code following best practices.

README: Comprehensive documentation.

Workload Table: Detailed task distribution between contributors.

UML Diagrams: Attached to the repository.
